# Van Gogh Gallery
This is my first website, dedicated to the life and work of the famous Dutch painter - Vincent Van Gogh. It was created during a web development course to practice the use of HTML, CSS and responsive web design.
Users may browse through four tabs - about, life, paintings and Loving Vincent.
